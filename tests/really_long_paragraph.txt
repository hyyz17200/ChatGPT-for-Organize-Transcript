Public Relations Review Fostering democracy through social media: Evaluating diametrically opposed nonprofit advocacy organizations' use of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube  Giselle A Auger   Abstract Nonprofit organizations contribute to a democratic society by allowing those with diverse opinions to assemble and voice these ideas. Social media has provided an extensive new marketplace in which such organizations can give voice to their ideas. Thus the purpose of this study was to explore and assess the use of social media (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube) for advocacy by nonprofit organizations with diametrically opposed points-ofview on two social issues, the pro-gun/gun control issue and the pro-choice/pro-life issue. Results of this study indicate that nonprofit advocacy organizations are using social media to ethically persuade people to their point of view, for the most part through use of one-way communication. Moreover, organizations are using the various social media for different purposes, providing thanks and recognition on Twitter, and soliciting feedback and other two-way communication with stakeholders on Facebook. Use of authority figures to communicate messages is generally reserved for YouTube.  Introduction The rise of social media has affected more than just communication practices -it has provided a substantial new platform for the democratization of interests and ideas by dramatically expanding the opportunity for expression of competing and controversial ideas in society. In doing so it has also has expanded and altered the importance of public relations. No longer are individuals and groups hindered by lack of access to print media or the limited dissemination of such collateral. Today, individuals and organizations may promote and persuade using the various platforms and tools of social media, potentially reaching anyone in cyberspace. And within organizations, the task of understanding and making use of such technologies to promote and persuade frequently falls under the guise of public relations. While all types of organizations are engaging in social media, it is particularly important for nonprofits to do so as they rely on individual support in the form of donations and volunteers, and they also rely on general public support for their very existence. Formation of nonprofit organizations can be seen as the result of the 1st Amendment, a cornerstone of American democracy. As far back as the early 1800s, Alexander de Tocqueville identified one of the unique and enduring features of this democratic society -the freedom for individuals to form organizations with like-minded people to address social issues through persuasion and advocacy. He did not identify the simultaneous opportunity for those with opposing viewpoints to organize, persuade and advocate on the same issue from their point-of-view, but in fact the 1st Amendment does so. In the U.S. such organizations are generally formed as tax-exempt or nonprofit organizations and are considered part of civil society or the third sector (Lohmann, 1992) as opposed to the government or business sectors of society. Though the size of the sector decreased in 2011 for the first time in decades as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) purged their records of inactive groups, it is still large with 1,629,149 registered Tax-Exempt Organizations and Nonexempt Charitable Trusts reported (IRS, 2012). Within the sector, individual organizational missions may be predominantly lacking in contentious ideas, or extremely contentious, for example the points-of-view espoused by the National Rifle Association (NRA) or Planned Parenthood. Communication of advocacy organizations' ideas may appear unduly biased or one-sided because of the passion those involved feel about their cause; however, it has been argued that democratic debate requires persuasion to alter the minds and behaviours of publics (Pattie & Johnston, 2008). Though often seen as a less optimal form of communication than two-way communication or dialogue, persuasion is a function of public relations and falls within the scope of advocacy. According to the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) advocacy is the first of six core professional behaviours that practitioners should exhibit. Advocacy is defined as "[serving] the public interest by acting as responsible advocates for those we represent. We provide a voice in the marketplace of ideas, facts, and viewpoints to aid informed public debate" (PRSA, 2012). Providing a voice in the marketplace of ideas is inherently democratic in nature as it provides just one voice or idea in a pluralistic marketplace full of contradictory, conflicting, and supporting ideas. Within nonprofit organizations the role of public relations is central to the dissemination of core values and building of support. Initially, the Internet provided organizations with space for organizational communication such as websites where content was often static. The dramatic shift of social networking sites from providing space for interpersonal communication to also providing for organization-public communication has changed the landscape for the marketplace of ideas. No longer can organizations allow information to remain static but the information they provide must compete with many more voices in the vast online communities of cyberspace, and the information must be timely, responsive, persuasive and transparent to compete within this large marketplace of ideas. Thus the purpose of this study was to explore and assess the use of social media (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube) for advocacy by nonprofit organizations with diametrically opposed points-of-view. Such organizations are created through the democratic freedoms of the 1st Amendment and their ideas represent the diversity and uniqueness of such government. As purveyors of these ideas to stakeholders of all kinds, it is important for public relations practitioners to understand how best to use social media for advocacy while encouraging increased communication of democratic interests and diversity in society.  Literature review This study incorporates the concepts of nonprofit organizations in a democratic society, the role of public relations in communicating diverse ideas in the marketplace of ideas, and the significance of social media in providing new platforms and opportunities for communication of such ideas. Each of these concepts is addressed in turn, beginning with nonprofit organizations in a democratic society.  Nonprofit organizations and democratic society Democracy in America is founded on the principles found within the First Amendment to the Constitution which grants individuals the freedoms of religion, the press, free speech, the right to assemble, and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances. In the early 1800s Alexander de Tocqueville wrote glowingly of American's propensity to assemble, or form associations to address social needs. He noted: In no country in the world has the principle of association been more successfully used or applied to a greater multitude of objects than in America. Besides the permanent associations which are established by law under the names of townships, cities, and counties, a vast number of others are formed and maintained by the agency of private individuals. (Chapter 12, para.1) He identified broad areas in which associations had been formed to address social issues such as intemperance, public safety, industry, and religion and concluded, "there is no end which the human will despairs of attaining through the combined power of individuals united into a society (Chapter 12, para. 3)". Today, these associations are known collectively as nonprofit organizations and are categorized by the IRS into 25 broad groups including the 501(c)(3) religious and charitable organizations to whom monetary contributions are tax deductible, and the remaining 24 categories including the 501(c)(4) public welfare organizations, to which contributions are not tax deductible. According to the IRS, today there are more than 1,600,000 nonprofit organizations in the U.S. (IRS, 2012). Some suggest that the vitality of the nonprofit sector is paramount to the continuation of a democratic society and that these organizations have an obligation to society to promote the needs of their constituents. As Greely (2006) explained,"Theory, history and practice have shown that a vibrant, independent, nonprofit sector is critical to democracy. As such nonprofits have an obligation to represent their constituents' needs to the government, media, and public at large" (p. 14). Such representation falls under the role of public relations, which has been defined as "the management of communication between an organization and its publics" (Grunig & Hunt, 1984, p. 6). And among the core types of communication techniques used by public relations is that of advocacy, addressed next.  Public relations advocacy The role of advocacy in public relations can be as quiet as reminding upper management of the concerns of local citizens to proposed actions by the organization, or as visible as professional lobbyists and issues advocates. And despite its importance, advocacy is often portrayed as a less satisfactory form of public relations than engaging in a dialogic process or building relationships with publics. In fact some equate advocacy with propaganda, perhaps as Freeman (2009) suggests, because "the communication materials of activist groups who are passionate about their cause. . .may appear close-minded or one-sided" (p. 271). Yet not all propaganda or persuasive communication need be unethical. As Freeman (2009) explains, "propaganda has some distinctive and largely negative characteristics that distinguish it from mere persuasive speech" (p. 271). Such distinctive characteristics include purposely distorting the message and misrepresenting information as well as concealing the source of the messenger from the audience. Further, propaganda may also reduce complex issues into suggestions of simple cause and effect, rely on the use of authority figures, and may place "emphasis on conflict over cooperation" (Freeman, 2009, p. 271). Because issues advocacy promotes the point-of-view from just one side of a social issue, it is often seen as a controversial form of communication. Such communication "moves beyond the traditional realm of promoting an organization's image, product, or service, into efforts to influence a legislative or regulatory outcome or a public policy debate" (Miller, 2006, p. 1). Despite its controversial nature, such persuasion is necessary to develop debate in the marketplace of ideas. For example, Pattie and Johnston (2008) contended, "Democratic debate depends upon the possibility of (hopefully rational) persuasion to change minds and behaviours" (p. 678). Among the key factors in developing persuasive appeals is the use of message strategy. As discussed below, several studies have examined the use and effectiveness of message strategy by nonprofit organizations.  Message strategy Studies have examined the importance of message structure in garnering support for advocated issues (Miller, 2006;Scudder & Mills, 2009;Weberling, 2012). In a study of shock advocacy Scudder and Mills (2009) found that the shock messages used by a nonprofit advocacy group were effective against the animal food processing industry without harming the reputation of the advocacy group. Moreover, through analysis of messages from industries whose behaviour could compromise the environment, Miller (2006) found that messages that focused on community identity, "using emotional appeals to highlight the community's sense of tradition and heritage" (p. 22), had the greatest effect on recipients. Messages that related to individual benefits from the industry's engagement with the community, such as increased prosperity and employment, were also influential. Further, in a qualitative content analysis of e-mail messages, Weberling (2012) identified three types of messages sent by a large nonprofit organization known for its advocacy on women's health -advocacy, fundraising, and news type messages. She noted that the advocacy and fundraising messages employed different rhetoric with advocacy messages designed to inspire logical decision-making and fundraising to appeal to readers' emotional decision-making. As such, the advocacy messages included facts and figures and in-depth information, while the fundraising messages "focused on hope, survival, and the 'face' of breast cancer" (p. 114). Advancing the study of advocacy in the online environment, Waters and Lord (2009) examined how advocacy groups build relationships on the Internet. Though the study found mixed support for how well these organizations integrated relationship-building into their website design, the authors provided several guidelines for improvement among which were listening and acting upon feedback and comments. Rapid changes in the development of online social media such as the social networking site Facebook and micro-blogging site Twitter have not lessened the soundness of these guidelines, though a great deal more research on social media, and the use of such media by nonprofits has ensued, as discussed below.  Nonprofit organizations use of social media Long gone are the days when organizations could consider themselves technologically up-to-date simply because they developed a website. Today, organizations must also be engaged in social media, a type of media that could not have been envisaged as part of organizational communication even at the start of the new millennium. As Saxton, Guo, and Brown (2007) noted, "the increasingly sophisticated second-generation Web technologies enable an intensity of interactions between [nonprofit] organizations and citizens and consumers in ways not previously possible" (p.144). They suggest that to achieve the goals of their missions, organizations must strategically consider the amount of information and interactivity of content that they provide to stakeholders in the online environment. Social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are by their very nature, built upon user interaction. Recent research by Lovejoy and Saxton (2012) categorized nonprofit organizations' use of Twitter into three major functions, Information, Action, and Community. Information related to provision of news about the organization and its activities, while the purpose of Community was to build relationships and create networks. The final function, Action, was comprised of items encouraging followers to engage in some kind of action such as donating, volunteering, or attending an event. Earlier research found that nonprofit organizations were not using Facebook to full potential. Though these organizations were transparent with the information provided in their organizational profile, they were not using the social networking capabilities of Facebook to "inform others and get them involved in organizational activities" (Waters et al., 2009, p. 106). Moreover, several studies have found one-way communication to be the predominant form of communication used by organizations on both Facebook and Twitter (Bortree & Seltzer, 2009;Lovejoy, Waters, & Saxton, 2012;Xifra & Grau, 2010). Conversely, in their examination of the American Red Cross's use of social media, Briones, Kuch, Liu, and Jin (2011) discovered the use of two-way dialogue, in particular in development of relationships with younger constituents, the local community, and the media. Little research has been conducted on the social implications of a third major social media site, that of YouTube. YouTube is the top video site in the world with an estimated 2 billion views per day (YouTube, 2011). The video sharing site has grown exponentially since the first video was uploaded in April 2005 to the point where an estimated 24 h of video is now uploaded every minute (YouTube, 2011). A study by English, Sweetser, and Ancu (2011) examined the use of persuasive appeals in political videos and found that "source credibility, [was] the highest-ranked appeal in terms of credibility among the participants in [the] study" (p. 744). Moreover, the use of humour appeals was far less successful than the use of fact-based arguments. Based on the importance of nonprofit organizations to a democratic society, the pluralistic and democratic marketplace of ideas, the importance of communicating persuasively within that marketplace, and the need to engage stakeholders with these ideas, the following research questions are proposed: RQ1. How are nonprofit advocacy groups contributing to the democratic marketplace of ideas through social media? RQ2. Have nonprofit advocacy groups moved beyond one-way communication in social media?
